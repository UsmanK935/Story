I jumped into the river, what did i see.......
Black eyed angel swam with me.......
A moon full of stars and astral cars.....
and all the figures i used to see....
all my lovers were there with me.....
all my past and futures.....
and we all went to heaven in a little row boat........
There was nothing to fear nothing to doubt.......
There was nothing to fear nothing to doubt.......


Karma police
I've given all i can it's not enough
I've given all i can but we are still on the payroll.......
