Jigsaw falling into place 
so there is nothing to explain
you eye each other as you pass 
she looks back
and you look back
not just once....
not just twice....
wish away the nightmare
wish away the nighmares
you got a light you can feel it on your back 
a light you can feel it on your back....
Jigsaw falling into place.....
